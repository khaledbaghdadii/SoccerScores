Project Title:

Football Scores


Description:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The project is a Java application that lets the user the scores of football matches scores in addition to other details about the match by specifying
the league and the round.
It currently supports the top leagues only like La Liga, Premium League, Champions League and few others.

Motivation
-----------------------------------------------------------------
I did this project in my free time while I was still learning about JSON and Java Swing at my second year at university.
I wanted to do a mini project to practice the new skills I was learning; and since I am passionate about football I chose that the project should be related to it and from here came the idea

Technologies Used:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-Java Swing
-football-data.org API
